# Devlog

A running log of what I'm building — security tooling, self-hosted infra, and
web projects. Sanitized on purpose: no addresses, hostnames, or secrets. The
interesting part is the work, not the IPs.

- Added TOTP two-factor auth to my self-hosted VPN dashboard (FastAPI + pyotp).
  Login now needs the access token plus a 6-digit code; a successful login
  mints a short-lived server-side session, so a leaked token alone is useless.
  Added replay protection, constant-time token comparison, and a fail2ban jail
  on the login endpoint.
- Hardened logging on the VPN box against tampering — append-only file
  attributes plus real-time forwarding to a separate append-only sink, so logs
  can't be quietly scrubbed even with root.
- Added a second, append-only backup destination for the VPN configs, with a
  scanner that refuses to overwrite existing backups.
- Shipped DRILL, a terminal-style cybersecurity reflex trainer (exact port
  numbers, HTTP status codes, subnet/CIDR math, Linux CLI) with adaptive
  difficulty and Leitner spaced repetition.
- Triaged a rootkit-scanner alert (turned out benign — unattended security
  upgrades shifting file hashes) and documented the recurring pattern.
- Stood up a temporary Reticulum mesh node to explore the network.
